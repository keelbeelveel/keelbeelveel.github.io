        I've put a lot of work into honing my CSS skills to make sure this site is done right. Unfortunately, doing things the right way means results come much slower than the "quick-n-dirty" approach. Today I have published the first of many style overhauls to the website. While the structure hasn't changed much, the appearance is much different. You have probably already noticed that it is very incomplete. Many elements are also currently occupied with placeholders and other garbage as I continue to refine my design. Feel free to look around, but don't expect a well-oiled machine. More is to come!
